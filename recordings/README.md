# Recordings

Real diagnostics CSVs from the tablet, used by `rt replay` / `rt calibrate` and replayed by CI on every push.

1. In OpenTabletDriver, enable **Enable Diagnostics** in the Rapid Trigger filter. Files go to
   `~/rapid-trigger-logs/` (Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\rapid-trigger-logs\`). A new file starts each time the
   filter is (re)applied.
2. Record one kind of motion per file and name it after its kind:
   - `drag-<what>-<date>.csv`: drags only. The tip stays down for each whole drag and lifts only at the end.
     Any release before that lift counts as a cut-out.
   - `tap-<what>-<date>.csv`: taps/streams the way you play.
3. Copy the files here and commit them (from a cloud session: upload/paste them, or push from any machine).

Calibrate with every drag file and every tap file:

```sh
dotnet tools/RtTool/bin/Release/net8.0/rt.dll calibrate $(printf -- '--drag %s ' recordings/drag-*.csv) $(printf -- '--tap %s ' recordings/tap-*.csv)
```
